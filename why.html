        <p>I personally prefer dgos over cats. I prefer them over cats, even though my dog is an absolute demon because they tend to be very affectionate and loyal. Cats will just throw things off of table and scratch all your furniture, and so will puppies, but dogs are loyal. My dog is my best friend, and she's a very good dog. She is very kind and loving, but she can be a very bad dog. Either way, I still love my dog.</p>
